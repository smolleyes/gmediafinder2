#~ "\n"
#~ "  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n"
#~ "freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n"
#~ "License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n"
#~ "software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n"
#~ "General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n"
#~ "Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n"
#~ "using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n"
#~ "the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n"
#~ "your programs, too.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
#~ "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n"
#~ "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n"
#~ "this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n"
#~ "if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n"
#~ "in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n"
#~ "anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n"
#~ "These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n"
#~ "distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n"
#~ "gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n"
#~ "you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n"
#~ "source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n"
#~ "rights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n"
#~ "(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n"
#~ "distribute and/or modify the software.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n"
#~ "that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n"
#~ "software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n"
#~ "want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n"
#~ "that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n"
#~ "authors' reputations.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n"
#~ "patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n"
#~ "program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n"
#~ "program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n"
#~ "patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"
#~ "modification follow.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n"
#~ "   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n"
#~ "a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n"
#~ "under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n"
#~ "refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n"
#~ "means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n"
#~ "that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n"
#~ "either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n"
#~ "language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n"
#~ "the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n"
#~ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n"
#~ "running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n"
#~ "is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n"
#~ "Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n"
#~ "Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n"
#~ "source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n"
#~ "conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n"
#~ "copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n"
#~ "notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n"
#~ "and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n"
#~ "along with the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n"
#~ "you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n"
#~ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n"
#~ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n"
#~ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n"
#~ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n"
#~ "    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n"
#~ "    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n"
#~ "    parties under the terms of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n"
#~ "    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n"
#~ "    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n"
#~ "    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n"
#~ "    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n"
#~ "    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n"
#~ "    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n"
#~ "    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n"
#~ "    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n"
#~ "    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n"
#~ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n"
#~ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n"
#~ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n"
#~ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n"
#~ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n"
#~ "on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n"
#~ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n"
#~ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote "
#~ "it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n"
#~ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n"
#~ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n"
#~ "collective works based on the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n"
#~ "with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n"
#~ "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n"
#~ "the scope of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n"
#~ "under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n"
#~ "Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n"
#~ "    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n"
#~ "    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; "
#~ "or,\n"
